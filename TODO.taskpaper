Tyrant Manager:

    Startup Script:
        - startup script generation -- simple shell, executes the tyrant-manager
        - main command line -- all the commands, and they take an optional instance
          or all -- no default
        - remove -- not yet
    Configuration:
        - Fix cascading config so it is not a work around for Loquacious 
          nattering on about undefined values.  A proper merged config
          would be better.
